# Schizosaccharomyces-pombe-Chip-seq-annotation

After getting the bed file from the Peak calling, we can annotate and create all downstream analysis from two sets of data


C1_summits.bed and C2_summits.bed are the output from MACS2 needed to perform the annotation

All the output results are uploaded individually
